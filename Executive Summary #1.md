- The system below is an open-source software verification system, in which open-source software developers, as well as corporate managers, can not only effectively verify open-source software components, the various licenses of such software, and any vulnerabilities that the software may have, but also verify that the licenses are set against company policy standards, so that they are utilized properly in the organization. 
- The software developer can submit an open-source software package to a systematic process of verifying its’ open-source software components, scan for any licenses that the package may have, and also sending the software through the NIST Vulnerability Database to verify any vulnerabilities that it may have. Once the results have been verified, the software package gets stored into a Open-Source Software License & Vulnerability Data Store, and the software developer receives the software package results. The corporate manager (as well as the software developer) in this organizational system can request policy information about a bevy of software packages (referred to as a OSS Project) by following a similar process; the project gets sent through a process in which it picks up the stored data information from the Data Store, and then scans the project against the company’s known policies on open-source software that are based on the Software Package License and Vulnerability Policy Data Store – a database full of known licensing and vulnerability policies. Once verified, this information completed the results of the OSS project, and gets sent back to the managers and/or developers. Along with verifying software project information, managers can also modify current company policies, or even create company policies that get stored in the Data Store.
- The system is designed so that both the software developers and the corporate managers can utilize a process that helps with the detection of vulnerabilities and licensing in a software project. Also, this system provides a method by which such identified license and vulnerability information can be compared against company policies that have been implemented by the managers. Implementation of this two-part structure into the company standards will harness a change into how the company will not only access open-source software, but also how the software, if verified, will be used into the company’s day-by-day procedures. A greater access into verified open-source software means that both managers and developers will have access to large-scale software projects – some that may have not been available through other methods. Once verified open-source software packages are implemented, this creates an opportunity for software developers to have their software package be set as the standard, and with copy-left licensing, other developers may be more willing to work on these set packages, allowing the open source community to be more involved in the project.
