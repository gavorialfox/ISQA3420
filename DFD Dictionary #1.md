-	Collective Project Information: 
    - The process of pulling requests from either the software developer or the corporate manager, verifying the software information in the OSS Software Package License and Vulnerability Data Store, and running the information against vulnerability policies in the Software Package License and Vulnerability Policy Data Store, returning the results to either the manager or the developer.
-	Completed OSS Project Results: 
  - The finalized OSS Project information after it has been pulled from the OSS data store, and ran against corporate policy information in the vulnerability policy data store for violations. 
-	Developer: 
  - The software developer responsible for the creation of the software package.
-	Manager: 
  - The corporate manager that is responsible for requesting multiple software packages (via the Project Requests) for testing against software vulnerability policies, as well as modifying or submitting new policy documents to be test against the Software Package License and Vulnerability Policy Data Store.
-	Modified/Submitted Policy Document: 
  - A policy document, either modified or created by the corporate manager, that is ready to be verified by the Software Package License and Vulnerability Policy Data Store through the OSS Policy Documentation process.
-	Modified/Submitted Policy Document Confirmation: 
  - A policy document, either modified or created by the corporate manager, that has been verified by the Software Package License and Vulnerability Policy Data Store though the OSS Policy Documentation process.
-	NIST Vulnerability Hub: 
  - A database of known published vulnerabilities.
-	OSS Policy Documentation: 
  - The process of verifying OSS software project requests against policy documents, as well as having stored policy documents in the system from the corporate manager. This information gets sent to the Software Package License and Vulnerability Data Store, and returned to the requester, either the manager or the developer. 
-   Project Request: 
  - The submitted request by either the manager or the developer, primed for verification of OSS components, licensing and vulnerabilities. 
-	Review Software Package for OSS Components: 
  - The process of verifying OSS packages, verifying their components & licensing from the NIST Vulnerability Hub, and both storing the results into the OSS Software Package License and Vulnerability Data Store, as well as returning the software package results to either the manager or the developer. 
-	Scan for License or Vulnerability Violations: 
  - The process of scanning the OSS Project Requests from either the manager or the developer through the Software Package License and Vulnerability Data Store for policy verification. 
-	Scan for Licenses: 
  - The process of verifying licenses of OSS software packages through the NIST Vulnerability Hub. 
-	Software Package: 
  - The software thatâ€™s being verified for licensing and vulnerability information
-	Software Package License and Vulnerability Data Store:
  - A database of known license vulnerabilites.
-	Software Package Results: 
  - The final results of the software package after it has been verified for OSS components, licensing, and software vulnerabilities through the NIST Vulnerability Hub. 
-	Verified Project OSS Request: 
  - The verified software project information from the OSS Software License and Vulnerability Data Store that is requested by either the developer or the manager. Information is primed for testing against policy documents in the Software Package License and Vulnerability Policy Data Store.
